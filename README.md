 Machine Learning Model Comparison with SHAP Visualization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on comparing the performance of four machine learning models—**Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, **XGBoost**, and **GBM**—for a classification task. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, ROC curve, and AUC score. Additionally, **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret the models and visualize feature importance, offering insights into the model's decision-making process.

## Key Techniques Used

- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical model used for binary classification.
- **SVM** (Support Vector Machine): A supervised learning model for classification tasks.
- **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting algorithm known for its performance and scalability.
- **GBM** (Gradient Boosting Machine): Another boosting algorithm for creating high-performing models.
- **SHAP**: A tool used for model interpretability, showing how features impact the model’s predictions.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for creating visualizations, including model performance comparisons and ROC curves.

## Key Features

- **Model Comparison**: The project compares Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, and GBM based on their accuracy and AUC scores.
- **ROC Curve**: Visualized the ROC curve for each model to understand the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.
- **Feature Importance**: SHAP visualizations demonstrate how each feature influences the predictions made by the models.
- **Advanced Data Visualization**: Created advanced, interactive plots to present model evaluation results and interpretation.
